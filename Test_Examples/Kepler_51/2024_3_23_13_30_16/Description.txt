Kepler-51 system.
Masses, radii, periods and eccentricities are taken as the mean value from Matsuda 2014
All radii were halved for a test
The argument of perihelion is randomly sampled from within the uncertainties from Libby-Roberts et al. 2020.
The orbital parameters are referred to the star.
