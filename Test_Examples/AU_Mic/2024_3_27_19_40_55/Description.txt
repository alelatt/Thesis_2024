AU Microscopii system integrated for 1E5yrs.
Masses, radii, periods and arguments of periastron are taken as the mean value from Wittrock et al. 2023
AU AU Mic d and AU Mic c were used.
The eccentricity is randomly sampled from within the uncertainties.
The orbital parameters are referred to the star.
